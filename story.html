<h1>My Story</h1>
<div class="story">
<p>Basketball...During my summer vacations in 2018, I used to play football all the time. Not one time I told 'let's play something else'. Then one day my good friend Kushal he told for once why not play basketball. I thought to myself "why not play for once" so i went and played. I didn't know a thing..... It took me one whole week to start dribbling without holding it again and again. Then it took me one whole month to play properly. My friend Kushal was my personal trainer. After a few months he taught me the turntable. That was my ultimate move. He taught me everything i needed to know. After a year he left hsr layout so i could not keep in touch. After he left my friends Yashmith and Amruth helped me alot. They were my rivals. After 2 years i was finally able to surpass Amruth and Yashmith. Kushal still comes back sometimes and still i cant beat him. I have many inspirations like Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant but the main guy who helped me the most was Kushal. ⁓Om Vijay⁓ </p>
